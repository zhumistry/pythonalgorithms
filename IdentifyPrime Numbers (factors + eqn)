Question:
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter an integer (X), then:
- Determine if X is prime or not
- If X is not prime, compute and print the factors of that integer X
- Evaluate and print the equation Y=8XÂ²+ 1, for X values from -5 to 5 using the range function and for loop



Solution:

def CheckPrime(X):
  Prime = 1
  HalfofX = int(X/2)
  for i in range(2,HalfofX+1):
    if (X % i) == 0:
      Prime = 0
      print('factors are:',i)
  print('factors are:',X)
  return Prime

Num = int(input('enter a number (X): '))
print('factors are: 1')
if CheckPrime(Num):
  print(Num, "is a prime number")
else:
  print(Num, "is not a prime number")

for Num in range(-5,6):
  print('Y is',8*(Num*Num) + 1)
