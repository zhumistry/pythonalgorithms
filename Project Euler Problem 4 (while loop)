Question:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3 digit numbers.

Solution:

def Palindrome(n):
  String = str(n)

  Last = len(String) - 1
  First = 0
  Max = Last/2
  Pal = 1

  while (Pal) and (Max < Last):
    if String[First] == String[Last]:
      First = First + 1
      Last = Last - 1
    else:
      Pal = 0

  if Pal == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return 0

FirstNum = 999
SecondNum = 999

Product = 0
Pal = 0

while Pal == 0:
  if FirstNum < SecondNum:
    Product = FirstNum * SecondNum
    if Palindrome(Product):
      Pal = 1
    else:
      SecondNum = SecondNum - 1
  elif FirstNum == SecondNum:
    Product = FirstNum * SecondNum
    if Palindrome(Product):
      Pal = 1
    else:
      FirstNum = FirstNum - 1


print('product is:',Product)
print('Firstnum:',FirstNum)
print('SecondNum:',SecondNum)
