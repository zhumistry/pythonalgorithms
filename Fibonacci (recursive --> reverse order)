Python program to display the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 100 in reverse order:


def recur_fibo(First, Second, Number): 
   Third = First + Second
   if Third <= Number:
       
       First = Second
       Second = Third
       recur_fibo(First, Second, Number)
   if Third <= Number:
       print(Third)


First = 1
Second = 1
Third = 100


print("Fibonacci sequence less than 100:")

recur_fibo(First, Second, Third)
print(Second)
print(First)
