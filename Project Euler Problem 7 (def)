Question:
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
#What is the 10 001st prime number?

Solution:

def CheckPrime(X):
  Prime = 1
  HalfofX = int(X/2)
  for i in range(2,HalfofX+1):
    if (X % i) == 0:
      Prime = 0
  return Prime

 
PrimeCounter = 2
CurrentNum = 3
while PrimeCounter != 10001:
  CurrentNum = CurrentNum + 2
  print(CurrentNum)
  if CheckPrime(CurrentNum):
    PrimeCounter += 1

print('1001st prime number is',CurrentNum)
