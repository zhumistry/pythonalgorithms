Question:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Solution:

sum = 0
First = 1
Second = 2
Third = 0

while Third <= 4000000:
  Third = First + Second
  print('New Third:',Third)
  First = Second
  Second = Third
  if Third%2 == 0 and Third <= 4000000:
    sum = sum + Third
    print('sum inside if:',sum)
    print('Third is:', Third)
  

print('sum is:',sum + 2)
