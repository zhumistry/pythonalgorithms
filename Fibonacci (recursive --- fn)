Python program to display the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 100:


def recur_fibo(First, Second, Number):
   Third = First + Second
   First = Second
   Second = Third 
   if Third <= Number:
       print(Third)
       recur_fibo(First, Second, Number)

First = 1
Second = 1
Third = 100


print("Fibonacci sequence:")
print(First)
print(Second)
recur_fibo(First, Second, Third)
